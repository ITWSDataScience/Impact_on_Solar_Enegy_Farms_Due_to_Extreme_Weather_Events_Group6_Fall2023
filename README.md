# Impact_on_Solar_Energy_Farms_Due_to_Extreme_Weather_Events_Group6_Fall2023

## Abstract
The growing global demand for reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable sources of energy, driven by technological advancements, emphasizes the importance of renewable energy solutions. Solar energy stands out as a promising and readily available energy to address the existing energy challenges. However, this is highly impacted by natural disasters which could affect solar energy farms.
This paper will extensively investigate the impact of natural disasters on solar energy farms in California to illustrate the need to ensure its resilience in the face of climate-related challenges. The datasets related to solar and extreme weather conditions which we obtained from various sources were cleaned and merged using Python. Then, using 5 models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Xtreme Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Regression, we assessed the correlation between different key features.
